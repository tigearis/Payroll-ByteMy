This document classifies all data fields in the Payroll ByteMy system according to SOC 2 compliance requirements and sensitivity levels.

## Classification Levels

### ðŸ”´ CRITICAL (Level 4)
**Definition**: Data that if exposed could cause severe financial, legal, or reputational damage.
**Handling**: Requires encryption at rest and in transit, strict access controls, and full audit logging.

### ðŸŸ  HIGH (Level 3)
**Definition**: Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and sensitive business data.
**Handling**: Requires encryption, role-based access, and audit logging for modifications.

### ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM (Level 2)
**Definition**: Internal business data and non-sensitive personal information.
**Handling**: Requires role-based access and basic audit logging.

### ðŸŸ¢ LOW (Level 1)
**Definition**: Public or non-sensitive configuration data.
**Handling**: Standard access controls, no special encryption requirements.
