# GraphQL Domains Alignment Audit Report

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive audit analyzes the GraphQL integration status and optimization opportunities for six key domains in the Payroll-ByteMy system. The audit reveals a critical situation: **GraphQL files for these domains have been deleted**, presenting both challenges and opportunities for strategic realignment.

### Key Findings:
- **Current Status**: GraphQL operations for billing, external-systems, leave, notes, and work-schedule domains have been removed
- **Database Schema**: All tables exist with proper Hasura metadata configuration
- **Business Logic**: Domain components and services remain functional but rely on deleted GraphQL operations
- **Opportunity**: Clean slate for implementing optimized GraphQL architecture
