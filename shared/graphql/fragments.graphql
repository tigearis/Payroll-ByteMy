# Shared GraphQL Fragments
# Common fragments used across domains

# Common timestamp fields (used as inline fragments)
# Note: These are commented out as they would need to be defined per-type
# or use a proper union/interface type that exists in the schema

# fragment TimestampFields on SomeSpecificType {
#   created_at
#   updated_at
# }

# fragment AuditFields on SomeSpecificType {
#   created_at
#   updated_at
#   created_by
#   updated_by
# }
