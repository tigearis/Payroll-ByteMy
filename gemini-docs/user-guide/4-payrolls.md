# Payrolls Guide

This guide explains how to manage payrolls in the application.

## Viewing Payrolls

To view a list of all payrolls, navigate to the **Payrolls** section of the application. This will display a table of all payrolls, with their name, status, and other information.

## Payroll Versioning

The application uses a sophisticated versioning system for payrolls. This means that every time you make a change to a payroll, a new version of that payroll is created. This allows you to track the history of changes to a payroll and to revert to a previous version if necessary.

## Adding a New Payroll

To add a new payroll, click the **Add New Payroll** button on the Payrolls page. This will open a form where you can enter the payroll's information, such as its name, the client it belongs to, and its schedule.

## Editing a Payroll

To edit a payroll, click the **Edit** button next to the payroll in the payroll list. This will create a new version of the payroll and open a form where you can update its information.

## Deleting a Payroll

To delete a payroll, click the **Delete** button next to the payroll in the payroll list. You will be asked to confirm that you want to delete the payroll before it is permanently removed from the system.
