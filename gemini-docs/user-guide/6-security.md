# Security Guide

This guide explains how to manage security in the application.

## Audit Log

The application keeps a detailed audit log of all actions that are performed in the system. To view the audit log, navigate to the **Security** section of the application. This will display a table of all audit log entries, with the user who performed the action, the action that was performed, and the date and time of the action.

## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

The application uses a role-based access control (RBAC) system to control access to resources. This means that users are assigned to roles, and roles are granted permissions to access resources. To manage roles and permissions, please contact your administrator.
