# Security (Detailed User Guide)

This guide provides a detailed explanation of the security features of the application.

## 1. The Security Dashboard

When you navigate to the **Security** section of the application, you will see a dashboard that gives you a complete overview of the security of the system. You can:

*   **View the Security Health Score:** This score is a high-level indicator of the security of the system. It is based on the number of failed operations and other security-related events.
*   **View Security Metrics:** The dashboard displays a number of key security metrics, such as the total number of operations, the number of failed operations, and the number of times that sensitive data has been accessed.
*   **View Recent Security Events:** The dashboard displays a list of recent security events, such as failed sign-in attempts and changes to user permissions.

## 2. Audit Log

The application keeps a detailed audit log of all actions that are performed in the system. To view the audit log, click the **View Full Audit Log** button on the security dashboard. This will take you to the audit log page, where you can see a complete history of all actions that have been performed in the system.

## 3. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

The application uses a role-based access control (RBAC) system to control access to resources. This means that users are assigned to roles, and roles are granted permissions to access resources. To manage roles and permissions, please contact your administrator.
