# Payrolls (Detailed User Guide)

This guide provides a detailed explanation of how to manage payrolls in the application. It covers everything from creating a new payroll to understanding the powerful versioning and scheduling features.

## 1. The Payrolls Dashboard

When you navigate to the **Payrolls** section of the application, you will see a dashboard that gives you a complete overview of all your payrolls. You can:

*   **Search and Filter:** Use the search bar and filters to quickly find the payroll you are looking for.
*   **View Payrolls:** See a list of all your payrolls, with key information like the client, the payroll schedule, and the current status.
*   **Add New Payrolls:** Click the **Add Payroll** button to create a new payroll.

## 2. Creating and Editing Payrolls

### 2.1. Creating a New Payroll

When you create a new payroll, you will be asked to provide the following information:

*   **Payroll Name:** A descriptive name for the payroll.
*   **Client:** The client this payroll belongs to.
*   **Payroll Schedule:** The frequency of the payroll (e.g., weekly, monthly) and the specific pay date (e.g., the 15th of the month).
*   **Go-Live Date:** The date when this payroll should become active.

Once you have created a payroll, the system will automatically calculate the pay dates for the next two years.

### 2.2. Editing a Payroll and Payroll Versioning

One of the most powerful features of this application is **payroll versioning**. Every time you edit a payroll, a new version of that payroll is created. This has several important benefits:

*   **History Tracking:** You have a complete history of all changes that have been made to a payroll. You can see who made the change, when they made it, and what they changed.
*   **Auditing:** The version history provides a clear audit trail for compliance purposes.
*   **Reverting to Previous Versions:** If you make a mistake, you can easily revert to a previous version of the payroll.

When you edit a payroll, you are actually creating a new version of that payroll. The old version is kept for historical purposes, and the new version becomes the active version on the **go-live date** that you specify.

## 3. Understanding Payroll Schedules

The application provides a flexible system for defining payroll schedules.

### 3.1. Payroll Cycles

You can choose from the following payroll cycles:

*   Weekly
*   Fortnightly
*   Bi-Monthly
*   Monthly
*   Quarterly

### 3.2. Pay Date Types

Once you have chosen a cycle, you can specify the pay date using one of the following types:

*   **Fixed Date:** The payroll is paid on a fixed day of the month (e.g., the 15th).
*   **End of Month (EOM):** The payroll is paid on the last day of the month.
*   **Start of Month (SOM):** The payroll is paid on the first day of the month.
*   **Week A/Week B:** For fortnightly payrolls, you can specify whether the payroll is paid in "Week A" or "Week B".
*   **Day of Week (DOW):** For weekly or fortnightly payrolls, you can specify the day of the week that the payroll is paid on.

### 3.3. Date Adjustments

The system automatically adjusts pay dates to ensure that they always fall on a business day. If a calculated pay date falls on a weekend or a public holiday, it will be moved to the nearest business day.
