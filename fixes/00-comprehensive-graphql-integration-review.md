## 🚨 Minor Issues Identified

### ⚠️ **Minor Optimizations Available**

#### ✅ API Consistency - RESOLVED
- **Previous Issue:** `components/invitations/invitation-management-table.tsx` used REST API
- **Status:** ✅ Successfully migrated to GraphQL via `useInvitationManagement` hook
- **Result:** Full architectural consistency achieved across all components

#### Direct Apollo Usage
- **Location:** Some dashboard components
- **Issue:** Direct `useQuery` imports instead of domain hooks
- **Recommendation:** Wrap in domain-specific hooks for consistency
- **Priority:** Low (works but could be more maintainable)

### 🔧 **Performance Optimization Opportunities**

#### Cache Management Complexity
- **Location:** `use-cache-invalidation.ts`
- **Issue:** Complex invalidation logic could benefit from centralization
- **Recommendation:** Consider cache management service
- **Priority:** Medium (optimization, not fix)

#### Polling Frequency
- **Location:** Various dashboard pages
- **Issue:** 60-second polling may be aggressive for some use cases
- **Recommendation:** Implement adaptive polling based on user activity
- **Priority:** Low (optimization)

## 🎯 Recommendations

### 🚀 **Immediate Actions (Low Priority)**

1. **API Consistency**
   - ✅ Migrate invitation management from REST to GraphQL - COMPLETED
   - Standardize error handling patterns across all components

2. **Documentation**
   - Document the critical Apollo link chain order
   - Create GraphQL operation naming conventions guide
   - Document real-time subscription patterns

### 🔮 **Future Enhancements**

1. **Performance**
   - Implement Redis-based distributed cache for multi-instance deployments
   - Add query complexity analysis and limiting
   - Implement query result caching for expensive operations

2. **Security**
   - Add mutation rate limiting per user/operation
