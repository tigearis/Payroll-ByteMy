# Billing Domain Mutations - TEMPORARILY DISABLED
# Security Classification: HIGH - Financial and billing data
# SOC2 Compliance: All mutations logged with comprehensive audit trail
# 
# NOTE: Billing operations temporarily commented out due to schema mismatches
# The following issues need to be resolved when billing is implemented:
# 1. Table name inconsistency: billingInvoice vs billingInvoices
# 2. Missing fields: paidAmount, paidDate, paymentMethod, paymentReference, etc.
# 3. Input type mismatches: billingInvoicesInsertInput vs billingInvoiceInsertInput
# 
# Uncomment and fix when billing table schema is finalized

# Placeholder mutation to keep the file valid for codegen
mutation PlaceholderBillingMutation {
  # This is a placeholder - replace with actual billing mutations when schema is ready
