#### `/.claude/CLAUDE.md` - Claude Code Configuration
**Changes Made:**
- Updated Authentication System description to reflect simplified approach
- Changed key files from complex token managers to simplified utilities
- Updated GraphQL Architecture from dual clients to unified client
- Updated Security Layer to emphasize audit logging and simplified stack

### 2. Comprehensive System Guide ‚úÖ

#### `/COMPREHENSIVE_SYSTEM_GUIDE.md` - Detailed Technical Documentation
**Changes Made:**
- **Authentication & Security Section**: Complete rewrite of multi-layer authentication system
  - Removed complex token management architecture (CentralizedTokenManager, ServerTokenManager)
  - Replaced with simplified SOC2 Auth Manager and unified Apollo Client
  - Updated authentication flow diagrams to show streamlined process
  - Simplified API route protection patterns
  - Updated middleware documentation to reflect SOC2 audit logging

**Key Sections Updated:**
- `### üîê Multi-Layer Authentication System` ‚Üí `### üîê Simplified Authentication System`
- Removed complex token encryption and management documentation
- Added simplified Clerk Hasura template integration examples
- Updated sequence diagrams to show automatic token refresh via Clerk

### 3. New Authentication Documentation ‚úÖ

#### `/docs/AUTHENTICATION_GUIDE.md` - NEW FILE
**Content:**
- Complete authentication architecture overview with mermaid diagrams
- Detailed implementation patterns and code examples
- SOC2 compliance features and audit logging
- Role-based access control documentation
- Data classification and protection guidelines
- Development patterns and troubleshooting guide
- Migration notes from the complex system

#### `/docs/AUTHENTICATION_MIGRATION.md` - NEW FILE
**Content:**
- Detailed migration summary from over-engineered to simplified system
- Before/after architecture comparison
- Technical changes with code examples
- Performance improvements and metrics
- Migration impact assessment
- Developer guide for using new system
- Rollback procedures and testing checklist

### 4. Domain Architecture ‚úÖ

#### `/DOMAIN_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Domain Structure Documentation
**Changes Made:**
- Updated `auth` domain description from complex token management to simplified integration
- Changed status from "Fully implemented" to "Simplified and optimized"
- Updated key files references to new simplified structure

### 5. Documentation That Remained Unchanged ‚úÖ

#### Files That Didn't Need Updates:
- `/docs/DATA_CLASSIFICATION_MATRIX.md` - Data classification levels remain the same
- `/docs/USER_DOCUMENTATION_STAFF_MANAGEMENT.md` - High-level user documentation remains valid
- `/database/README.md` - Database structure and RBAC system unchanged
- `/docs/payroll-processing.md` - Business logic documentation unaffected
- `/docs/README.md` - General project documentation remains valid

**Reason:** These documents focus on data structure, user workflows, and business logic rather than authentication implementation details.

## Architecture Changes Reflected

### Before (Over-Engineered):
```
User Request ‚Üí Middleware ‚Üí CentralizedTokenManager ‚Üí TokenEncryption ‚Üí 
AuthMutex ‚Üí ServerTokenManager ‚Üí DualApolloClients ‚Üí CustomHeaders ‚Üí Hasura
```

### After (Simplified):
```
User Request ‚Üí Middleware (Audit) ‚Üí Clerk Hasura Template ‚Üí Apollo Client ‚Üí Hasura
```

## Key Documentation Themes Updated

### 1. **Simplified Authentication Flow**
- Removed references to complex token encryption and management
- Added Clerk's Hasura template integration
- Emphasized automatic token refresh and lifecycle management

### 2. **SOC2 Compliance Maintained**
- Updated audit logging implementation from complex system to middleware/Apollo client
- Maintained role-based access control documentation
- Preserved data classification and masking requirements

### 3. **Developer Experience**
- Simplified code examples throughout documentation
- Reduced complexity in implementation patterns
- Clearer authentication debugging and troubleshooting

### 4. **Performance and Reliability**
- Documented performance improvements (build times, bundle sizes)
- Emphasized industry-standard practices over custom implementations
- Highlighted reliability benefits of using proven Clerk patterns

## Documentation Structure

### Primary Entry Points:
1. **`/CLAUDE.md`** - Main system overview and quick start
2. **`/docs/AUTHENTICATION_GUIDE.md`** - Comprehensive authentication documentation
