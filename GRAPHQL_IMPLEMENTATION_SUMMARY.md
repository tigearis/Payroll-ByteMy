# GraphQL Implementation Summary

## Completed Work

### Phase 1: Analysis and Documentation ✅
1. **Codebase Audit**: Analyzed all pages and components that interact with data
2. **Schema Analysis**: Created comprehensive Hasura schema documentation
3. **Data Flow Documentation**: Mapped GraphQL requirements for each component

### Phase 2: Design and Planning ✅
1. **Fragment Design**: Created reusable fragment strategy to avoid codegen issues
2. **Query Optimization**: Designed efficient queries for each use case
3. **Performance Strategy**: Implemented database-level aggregation patterns

### Phase 3: Implementation ✅
1. **File Structure**: Created organized GraphQL directory structure
2. **Shared Fragments**: Implemented reusable fragments in `shared/graphql/fragments.graphql`
3. **Shared Queries**: Created cross-domain queries in `shared/graphql/queries.graphql`
4. **Shared Mutations**: Implemented common mutations
5. **Shared Subscriptions**: Added real-time subscription patterns
6. **Domain-Specific Operations**: Created GraphQL files for:
   - Clients domain (queries, mutations, subscriptions, fragments)
   - Payrolls domain (queries, mutations, subscriptions, fragments)
   - Users domain (queries, mutations, subscriptions, fragments)
   - Permissions domain (queries, mutations, subscriptions)
   - Audit domain (queries, mutations, subscriptions)

### Phase 4: Configuration ✅
1. **GraphQL Codegen**: Configured for domain-driven generation with fragment sharing
2. **Dependencies**: Installed required GraphQL tooling

## Current Status

### Schema Mismatches Identified
The GraphQL operations were written based on an idealized schema, but the actual Hasura schema has different field names and structures:

1. **Field Name Differences**:
   - Expected: `role`, `active`, `lastLoginAt` on users
   - Actual: `isActive`, `isStaff`, no role field, no lastLoginAt
   
2. **Missing Tables/Types**:
   - No `userRoles`, `rolePermissions`, `permissionOverrides` tables
   - No `authSessions`, `apiKeys`, `invitations` tables
   - Audit tables not in the schema export

3. **Relationship Differences**:
   - Users don't have `consultant` relationship to clients
   - Payrolls use `primaryConsultantUserId` instead of relationships

## Next Steps Required

### Option 1: Update GraphQL to Match Current Schema
- Rewrite all GraphQL operations to use actual field names
- Remove references to non-existent tables
- Simplify permission model to match current implementation

### Option 2: Update Database Schema
- Add missing tables for full RBAC implementation
- Add missing fields to support the designed operations
- Implement proper relationships

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Recommended)
1. **Immediate**: Fix GraphQL to work with current schema
2. **Phase 2**: Gradually add missing schema elements
3. **Maintain**: Keep GraphQL and schema in sync

## Files Created

### Documentation
- `/HASURA_SCHEMA_DOCUMENTATION.md` - Complete schema analysis
- `/GRAPHQL_DATA_FLOW_DOCUMENTATION.md` - Component data requirements
- `/GRAPHQL_FRAGMENT_DESIGN.md` - Fragment strategy and patterns

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Fragment Strategy**: Use shared fragments with domain imports to avoid "unknown fragment" errors
2. **Performance**: Implement database-level aggregation instead of client-side calculations
3. **Type Safety**: Configure GraphQL Codegen with client preset for modern TypeScript support
4. **Security**: Document security levels for SOC2 compliance

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Action**: Decide on schema alignment strategy (Option 1, 2, or 3 above)
2. **Schema Management**: Implement schema versioning and migration strategy
3. **Testing**: Add GraphQL operation tests before production deployment
4. **Documentation**: Keep schema documentation synchronized with changes

## Success Metrics

- ✅ All GraphQL operations organized by domain
- ✅ Fragment reuse strategy implemented
- ✅ Performance optimizations documented
- ✅ TypeScript code generation configured
- ❌ Schema alignment pending (requires decision)
- ❌ Type generation pending (blocked by schema mismatch)
