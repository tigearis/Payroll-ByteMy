âŽ¿ Work Schedule Implementation Plan: Consultant Capacity Management with Position-Based Admin Time

    Document Overview

    This detailed implementation plan outlines the development of a comprehensive consultant capacity management system that integrates work schedules with payroll
    processing, accounting for organizational positions and admin time allocation to optimize remote consultant workload allocation.

    Business Requirements Summary

    Core Problem Statement

    - Remote consultants have flexible schedules (set days/hours, no fixed start/end times)
    - Different organizational positions require different admin time allocations
    - Payrolls have processing time requirements and deadline constraints
    - Managers need visibility into realistic consultant capacity vs. workload for optimal assignment
    - System must prevent overallocation and identify scheduling conflicts before they impact EFT dates

    Organizational Structure

    Business Positions (New):
    - Consultant (10-15% admin time)
    - Senior Consultant (15-20% admin time)
    - Manager (40-50% admin time)
    - Senior Manager (50-60% admin time)
    - Partner (60-70% admin time)
    - Senior Partner (70-80% admin time)

    System Access Roles (Existing):
    - viewer, consultant, manager, org_admin, developer (for permissions only)

    Success Metrics

    - 100% visibility into realistic consultant capacity utilization accounting for admin time
    - Position-appropriate admin time allocation and tracking
    - Automated detection of workload conflicts
    - Optimized payroll assignments based on actual consultant availability
    - Zero missed EFT dates due to scheduling conflicts

    Database Schema Enhancements Required

    1. Add Position Field to Users Table

    -- Add organizational position to users table
    ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN position VARCHAR(20)
      CHECK (position IN ('consultant', 'senior_consultant', 'manager', 'senior_manager', 'partner', 'senior_partner'));

    -- Set default admin time percentages by position
    ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN default_admin_time_percentage DECIMAL(5,2) DEFAULT 15.0;

    -- Migration to set existing users' positions based on current roles (temporary)
    UPDATE users SET
      position = CASE
        WHEN role = 'consultant' THEN 'consultant'
        WHEN role = 'manager' THEN 'manager'
        WHEN role = 'org_admin' THEN 'senior_manager'
        WHEN role = 'developer' THEN 'senior_consultant'
        ELSE 'consultant'
      END,
      default_admin_time_percentage = CASE
        WHEN role = 'consultant' THEN 15.0
        WHEN role = 'manager' THEN 45.0
        WHEN role = 'org_admin' THEN 55.0
        WHEN role = 'developer' THEN 20.0
        ELSE 15.0
      END;

    2. Enhance Work Schedules with Admin Time

    -- Add admin time tracking to work schedules
    ALTER TABLE work_schedules ADD COLUMN admin_time_hours DECIMAL(4,2) DEFAULT 0;
    ALTER TABLE work_schedules ADD COLUMN payroll_capacity_hours DECIMAL(4,2);
    ALTER TABLE work_schedules ADD COLUMN uses_default_admin_time BOOLEAN DEFAULT true;

    -- Create calculated field for payroll capacity
    -- payroll_capacity_hours = work_hours - admin_time_hours

    3. Position-Based Admin Time Configuration

    -- Table for default admin time by position (for easy management)
    CREATE TABLE position_admin_defaults (
      position VARCHAR(20) PRIMARY KEY,
      default_admin_percentage DECIMAL(5,2) NOT NULL,
      description TEXT,
      updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
    );

    -- Insert default values
    INSERT INTO position_admin_defaults VALUES
      ('consultant', 12.5, 'Basic admin tasks, team meetings', NOW()),
      ('senior_consultant', 17.5, 'Admin tasks plus mentoring junior staff', NOW()),
      ('manager', 45.0, 'Team management, client meetings, planning', NOW()),
      ('senior_manager', 55.0, 'Strategic management, multiple teams', NOW()),
      ('partner', 65.0, 'Business development, client relations, strategy', NOW()),
      ('senior_partner', 75.0, 'Executive duties, firm management, partnerships', NOW());

    Technical Architecture Assessment

    Enhanced Capacity Calculation Logic

    // New capacity calculation with admin time
    interface CapacityCalculation {
      totalWorkHours: number;
      adminTimeHours: number;
      payrollCapacityHours: number;
      currentlyAssignedHours: number;
      availableCapacityHours: number;
      utilizationPercentage: number;
      adminTimeSource: 'default' | 'custom';
    }

    // Calculation formula
    const calculateCapacity = (workHours: number, position: string, customAdminHours?: number) => {
      const adminHours = customAdminHours ?? (workHours * getDefaultAdminPercentage(position) / 100);
      const payrollCapacity = workHours - adminHours;
      return {
        totalWorkHours: workHours,
        adminTimeHours: adminHours,
        payrollCapacityHours: payrollCapacity,
        adminTimeSource: customAdminHours ? 'custom' : 'default'
