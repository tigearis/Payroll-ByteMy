# Inherited Roles Configuration
# This creates a hierarchical permission system where higher roles automatically inherit lower role permissions

# Organization Admin inherits all manager, consultant, and viewer permissions
- role_name: org_admin
  role_set:
    - manager
    - consultant  
    - viewer

# Manager inherits all consultant and viewer permissions
- role_name: manager
  role_set:
    - consultant
    - viewer

# Consultant inherits all viewer permissions
- role_name: consultant
  role_set:
    - viewer

# Base roles (no inheritance):
# - developer: Standalone with full access (doesn't need inheritance)
# - viewer: Base level, lowest permissions (foundation for hierarchy)
