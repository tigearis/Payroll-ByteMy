## Permission System Logic

### Permission Priority Order
1. **Individual Restrictions** (highest priority) - Always deny access
2. **Individual Grants** - Override role permissions to allow access
3. **Role Permissions** (lowest priority) - Default permissions based on user role

### Role Hierarchy
Higher-level roles inherit permissions from lower levels:
- **Developer** (Level 5): All permissions
- **Org Admin** (Level 4): Most permissions except some developer tools
- **Manager** (Level 3): Team and operational management
- **Consultant** (Level 2): Basic payroll processing
- **Viewer** (Level 1): Read-only access

### Temporary Permissions
- Set expiration dates for permission overrides
- Automatically reverts to role-based permissions when expired
- Useful for temporary access grants

## Search and Filtering

### Permission Search
- Use the search box in the Permissions tab
- Search works across all permission names
- Real-time filtering as you type
- Case-insensitive search

### Category Organization
Permissions are automatically organized by category for easy browsing:
- Expand/collapse categories as needed
- Visual grouping makes finding permissions easier

## Required Permissions

### To Edit User Information

### To Manage Permissions

## Best Practices

### Permission Management
1. **Always provide reasons** for permission changes (required for audit trail)
2. **Use temporary permissions** when possible for security
3. **Review active overrides regularly** to ensure they're still needed
4. **Prefer role changes** over individual permission grants when appropriate

### User Role Assignment
1. **Start with the lowest appropriate role** and add specific permissions as needed
2. **Use manager role** for team leads who need staff management capabilities
3. **Reserve org_admin and developer roles** for trusted administrators
4. **Regular review** of user roles and permissions

### Security Considerations
1. **Monitor permission changes** through the audit trail
2. **Set expiration dates** for temporary access
3. **Remove unused overrides** to maintain clean permission structure
4. **Document reasons clearly** for compliance and future reference
