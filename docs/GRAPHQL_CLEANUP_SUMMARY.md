# GraphQL Cleanup Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the GraphQL folder structure cleanup performed on June 18, 2025, to consolidate and simplify the codebase.

## What Was Cleaned Up

### ❌ **Removed Folders**
1. **`/graphql-operations/`** - SOC2-structured GraphQL operations
   - Purpose: Experimental SOC2 compliance structure
   - Status: Never actively used or generated
   - Backup: `_backup_delete/graphql_cleanup_20250618_152110/`

2. **`/graphql-secure/`** - Security-classified GraphQL operations
   - Purpose: Experimental security classification system
   - Status: Never actively used or generated
   - Backup: `_backup_delete/graphql_cleanup_20250618_152110/`

### ❌ **Removed Configurations**
- **`config/codegen-soc2.ts`** - SOC2 codegen configuration
- **`config/codegen-secure.ts`** - Security-classified codegen configuration

## What Remains (Current Working System)

### ✅ **Active GraphQL System**

#### **1. Domain-Driven Generated Types** (`/domains/*/graphql/`)
- **Purpose**: Modern domain-driven architecture with generated TypeScript types
- **Configuration**: `config/codegen.ts`
- **Command**: `pnpm codegen`
- **Status**: ✅ Active and up-to-date

**Domains**:
- `payrolls/` - Payroll operations with comprehensive mutations and queries
- `clients/` - Client management operations
- `users/` - User management (recently added)
- `billing/` - Invoice and billing operations
- `leave/` - Employee leave management
- `work-schedule/` - Work scheduling and time tracking
- `auth/` - Authentication operations
- `audit/` - SOC2 compliance and audit logging

#### **2. Legacy TypeScript Operations** (`/graphql/`)
- **Purpose**: Hand-written GraphQL operations used by API routes
- **Structure**: Traditional Next.js GraphQL organization
- **Status**: ✅ Working and actively used by server-side code

**Structure**:
```
graphql/
├── fragments/           # TypeScript fragment definitions
├── mutations/          # Organized by business domain
├── queries/            # Hand-written query operations
├── schema/             # Schema introspection and AST
└── subscriptions/      # Real-time subscriptions
```

## Current Import Patterns

### **Domain System Imports**
```typescript
// Generated types and hooks
import { useGetPayrollsQuery } from '@/domains/payrolls/graphql/generated';
import { PayrollFragment } from '@/domains/payrolls/graphql/generated/graphql';
```

### **Legacy System Imports**
```typescript
// Hand-written operations (primarily in API routes)
import { GET_PAYROLLS } from '@/graphql/queries/payrolls/getPayrolls';
import { CREATE_CLIENT } from '@/graphql/mutations/clients/createClient';
```

## Benefits of Cleanup

### ✅ **Simplified Architecture**
- Reduced from 4 GraphQL systems to 2 working systems
- Clear separation of concerns between generated types and hand-written operations
- Eliminated unused experimental structures

### ✅ **Improved Maintainability**
- Single codegen configuration to maintain (`config/codegen.ts`)
- Clear distinction between domain-driven types and legacy operations
- Reduced cognitive load for developers

### ✅ **Better Documentation**
- Updated all documentation to reflect current reality
- Clear explanation of hybrid system approach
- Removed references to unused systems

## Migration Path (Future)

If desired, the remaining legacy operations can be gradually migrated to the domain system:

### **Option 1: Gradual Migration**
- Move legacy operations to domain GraphQL files when touching API routes
- Update imports from `/graphql/` to domain-generated types
- Eventually deprecate legacy structure

### **Option 2: Keep Hybrid System**
- Maintain current working hybrid approach
- Use domain system for new frontend development
- Keep legacy operations for stable API routes

## Backup and Recovery

### **Backup Location**
All removed folders are safely backed up at:
```
_backup_delete/graphql_cleanup_20250618_152110/
├── graphql-operations/     # Complete SOC2 structure
├── graphql-secure/         # Complete security classification
├── codegen-soc2.ts        # SOC2 codegen config
└── codegen-secure.ts      # Security codegen config
```

### **Recovery Instructions**
If needed, the experimental structures can be restored:
```bash
# Restore SOC2 structure
cp -r _backup_delete/graphql_cleanup_20250618_152110/graphql-operations/ .

# Restore security structure
cp -r _backup_delete/graphql_cleanup_20250618_152110/graphql-secure/ .

# Restore configurations
cp _backup_delete/graphql_cleanup_20250618_152110/codegen-*.ts config/
```

## Testing Results

### ✅ **Post-Cleanup Verification**
- ✅ Application starts successfully (`pnpm dev`)
- ✅ Production build completes (`pnpm build`)
- ✅ Current codegen runs successfully (`pnpm codegen`)
- ✅ All existing functionality preserved
- ✅ No broken imports or missing dependencies

### ✅ **Working Systems Confirmed**
- Domain-driven types generation working
- Legacy operations still accessible
- API routes functioning normally
- Frontend components using generated types

## Summary

The GraphQL cleanup successfully simplified the codebase by removing unused experimental structures while preserving all working functionality. The current hybrid system provides:

- **Modern development experience** with domain-driven generated types
- **Stability** through proven legacy operations for API routes  
- **Clear architecture** with well-defined purposes for each system
- **Future flexibility** for continued evolution

**Result**: Cleaner, more maintainable codebase with preserved functionality and clear architectural direction.
