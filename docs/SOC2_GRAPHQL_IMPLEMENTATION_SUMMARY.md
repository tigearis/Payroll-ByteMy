# SOC 2 Compliant GraphQL Implementation Summary

## üéØ Executive Summary

This document summarizes the comprehensive implementation of a SOC 2 compliant GraphQL scaffold and codegen system for the Payroll-ByteMy application. The implementation focuses on secure handling of highly sensitive payroll data with full audit trails, role-based access control, and compliance tracking.

## üìã What Was Implemented

### 1. Data Classification System

**Created**: `DATA_CLASSIFICATION_MATRIX.md`
- Classified all database fields into 4 security levels: CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW
- Defined handling requirements for each classification level
- Established retention policies and compliance requirements

### 2. Secure GraphQL Schema Structure

**Directory**: `graphql-secure/`
```
graphql-secure/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ schema/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ base/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scalars.graphql      # Security-aware scalar types
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ enums.graphql        # Enumeration types with classifications
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ audit-types.graphql  # Audit and compliance types
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sensitive/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ user-types.graphql   # User types with PII annotations
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ payroll-types.graphql # Financial data types
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ public/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ operations/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ critical/                 # Admin-only operations
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sensitive/               # Operations with PII/financial data
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ standard/                # Low-sensitivity operations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fragments/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ secure/                  # Fragments containing sensitive fields
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ public/                  # Public-safe fragments
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ generated/                   # Auto-generated code
```

### 3. Security-Enhanced Codegen

## üìä Security Classifications Applied

### Critical Data (Requires Admin + MFA + Full Audit)
- SSN (future)
- Bank account information (future)
- Salary data (future)
- Tax information (future)

### High Data (Requires Audit + Encryption)
- User names and emails
- Contact information
- Financial dates (EFT, processing dates)
- Employee counts
- Leave reasons

### Medium Data (Requires Role-Based Access)
- User roles and assignments
- Payroll configurations
- Work schedules
- General notes

### Low Data (Standard Access)
- Public holidays
- System configurations
- Basic IDs and timestamps

## üöÄ How to Use the New System

### 1. Running Secure Codegen

```bash
# Generate all secure GraphQL artifacts
pnpm graphql-codegen --config codegen-secure.ts

# This will generate:
# - Type-safe operations separated by security level
# - Secure Apollo hooks with built-in validation
# - MSW handlers for testing
# - Audit type definitions
```

### 2. Using Secure Operations

```typescript
// Standard operations (LOW/MEDIUM security)
import { useGetTeamMembersQuery } from '@/graphql-secure/generated/operations/standard';

// Sensitive operations (HIGH security - auto-audited)
import { useGetUserByIdQuery } from '@/graphql-secure/generated/operations/sensitive';

// Critical operations (CRITICAL security - requires admin + MFA)
import { useDeleteUserCompleteMutation } from '@/graphql-secure/generated/operations/critical';

// The hooks automatically enforce security requirements
const { data, error } = useGetUserByIdQuery({
  variables: { id: userId },
  // Audit logging happens automatically
  // Role validation happens automatically
  // Rate limiting is enforced
});
```

### 3. Implementing Audit Logging

```typescript
import { auditLogger, AuditAction, DataClassification } from '@/lib/audit/audit-logger';

// Manual audit logging
await auditLogger.log({
  userId: session.userId,
  userRole: session.role,
  action: AuditAction.UPDATE,
  entityType: 'payroll',
  entityId: payrollId,
  dataClassification: DataClassification.HIGH,
  fieldsAffected: ['employee_count'],
  previousValues: { employee_count: 50 },
  newValues: { employee_count: 55 },
  requestId: crypto.randomUUID(),
  success: true,
}, request);

// Or use the decorator
class PayrollService {
  @Audited(AuditAction.UPDATE, 'payroll', DataClassification.HIGH)
  async updateEmployeeCount(payrollId: string, count: number) {
    // Method implementation
  }
}
```

### 4. Monitoring Security Events

```typescript
// Security events are automatically created for:
// - Multiple failed attempts (5+ in 5 minutes)
// - Excessive data exports (10+ in 1 hour)
// - CRITICAL operation attempts
// - Unauthorized access attempts

// Query security events
const { data } = await apolloClient.query({
  query: gql`
    query GetSecurityEvents {
      security_event_log(
        where: { resolved: { _eq: false } }
        order_by: { created_at: desc }
      ) {
        id
        event_type
        severity
        details
        created_at
      }
    }
  `,
});
```

## üîß Maintenance and Customization

### Adding New Sensitive Fields

1. Update the schema with security annotations:
```graphql
type new_table {
  """
  Sensitive field description
  @securityLevel: HIGH
  @pii: true
  @audit: true
  """
  sensitive_field: String!
}
```

2. Update the data classification matrix
3. Run codegen to regenerate secure types
4. Implement appropriate access controls in Hasura

### Adding New Operations

1. Create operation in appropriate directory:
   - `operations/critical/` for admin-only
   - `operations/sensitive/` for PII/financial
   - `operations/standard/` for general

2. Add security metadata:
```graphql
"""
Operation description
@securityLevel: HIGH
@requiredRole: manager
@rateLimit: 10/minute
@audit: true
"""
query NewSensitiveQuery {
  # Query implementation
}
```

3. Update `operationSecurityMap` in secure Apollo client
4. Run codegen

### Compliance Reporting

```sql
-- Monthly access review
SELECT 
  u.email,
  u.role,
  COUNT(DISTINCT al.entity_type) as accessed_entities,
  COUNT(*) as total_operations,
  MAX(al.created_at) as last_activity
FROM audit_log al
JOIN users u ON al.user_id = u.id
WHERE al.created_at >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY u.id, u.email, u.role
ORDER BY total_operations DESC;

-- Data export audit
SELECT 
  dal.user_id,
  u.email,
  dal.data_type,
  dal.data_classification,
  SUM(dal.record_count) as total_records,
  COUNT(*) as export_count
FROM data_access_log dal
JOIN users u ON dal.user_id = u.id
WHERE dal.export_format IS NOT NULL
AND dal.accessed_at >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '90 days'
GROUP BY dal.user_id, u.email, dal.data_type, dal.data_classification;
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Security Considerations

### 1. Environment Variables
Ensure these are properly configured:
- `HASURA_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN` - For secure server operations
- `ENCRYPTION_KEY` - For encrypting audit logs (production)
- `MFA_ENFORCEMENT` - Enable for production

### 2. Regular Security Tasks
- **Daily**: Review unresolved security events
- **Weekly**: Check failed authentication patterns
- **Monthly**: Access review for HIGH/CRITICAL data
- **Quarterly**: Full compliance check
- **Annually**: Security training verification

### 3. Incident Response
1. Security events are automatically logged
2. Critical events trigger immediate alerts
3. All incidents must be resolved with notes
4. Maintain incident response playbook

## üéì Training Requirements

### For Developers
1. Understand data classification levels
2. Use appropriate fragments for queries
3. Never bypass security controls
4. Report security concerns immediately

### For Administrators
