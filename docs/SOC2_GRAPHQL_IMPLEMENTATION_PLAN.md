# SOC 2 Compliant GraphQL Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive implementation of a SOC 2 compliant GraphQL scaffold and codegen system for the Payroll-ByteMy application, focusing on secure handling of highly sensitive payroll data.

## 🔒 Security Classification Levels

### Data Sensitivity Tiers

1. **CRITICAL** - Payroll financial data, SSN, bank details
2. **HIGH** - Employee PII, salary information, tax data
3. **MEDIUM** - Work schedules, leave records, general employee data
4. **LOW** - Public holidays, system configurations

### Access Control Matrix

| Role | Critical Data | High Data | Medium Data | Low Data |
|------|--------------|-----------|-------------|----------|
| admin | Full Access | Full Access | Full Access | Full Access |
| org_admin | Read/Write with Audit | Full Access | Full Access | Full Access |
| manager | No Access | Team Only | Team Only | Full Access |
| consultant | No Access | Assigned Only | Assigned Only | Full Access |
| viewer | No Access | No Access | Read Only (Limited) | Full Access |

## 🔐 Security Controls

### 1. Field-Level Security
- Implement field-level encryption for CRITICAL data
- Use column-level permissions in Hasura
- Apply data masking for sensitive fields

### 2. Row-Level Security
- Enforce organization boundaries
- Implement team-based access controls
- Apply temporal access restrictions

### 3. Operation-Level Security
- Classify all operations by sensitivity
- Implement rate limiting by operation type
- Enforce audit logging for sensitive operations

### 4. Transport Security
- Enforce TLS 1.3 minimum
- Implement certificate pinning
- Use secure WebSocket connections

## 📊 Compliance Requirements

### SOC 2 Trust Service Criteria

1. **Security (CC)**
   - Access controls
   - Encryption at rest and in transit
   - Vulnerability management

2. **Availability (A)**
   - Service monitoring
   - Incident response
   - Disaster recovery

3. **Processing Integrity (PI)**
   - Data validation
   - Error handling
   - Transaction integrity

4. **Confidentiality (C)**
   - Data classification
   - Access restrictions
   - Encryption standards

5. **Privacy (P)**
   - PII handling
   - Data retention
   - Right to erasure

## 🚀 Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Schema Analysis & Classification
1. Analyze current schema for sensitive data
2. Classify all fields by sensitivity
3. Document data flows and dependencies

### Phase 2: Permission Model Enhancement
1. Implement granular permissions
2. Add field-level security
3. Create audit triggers

### Phase 3: GraphQL Operations Refactor
1. Reorganize operations by security level
2. Implement secure fragments
3. Add operation-level validation

### Phase 4: Codegen Configuration
1. Configure type generation with security annotations
2. Generate secure hooks with built-in validation
3. Create MSW handlers for testing

### Phase 5: Audit & Monitoring
1. Implement comprehensive audit logging
2. Create compliance dashboards
3. Set up automated security scans
