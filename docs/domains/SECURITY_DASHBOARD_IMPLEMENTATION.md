# Security & Compliance Dashboard Implementation

## Overview

I've successfully created a comprehensive security and compliance dashboard for your Payroll-ByteMy application. This dashboard provides real-time monitoring of security events, audit trails, and compliance status in accordance with SOC 2 requirements.

## What Was Created

### 1. Main Security Dashboard (`/app/(dashboard)/security/page.tsx`)

The main dashboard provides:

- **Security Health Score**: Real-time calculation of operation success rate
- **Key Metrics Grid**:
  - Total operations (24h)
  - Failed operations requiring investigation
  - Critical data access (7 days)
  - Total records accessed
- **Tabbed Views**:
  - Security Events: Unresolved security incidents
  - Failed Operations: Operations that failed in the last 24 hours
  - Critical Access: Access to critical classified data
  - Compliance: Latest compliance check results
- **Quick Actions**: Links to audit log, access review, and compliance reports

### 2. Audit Log Viewer (`/app/(dashboard)/security/audit/page.tsx`)

Comprehensive audit trail viewer with:

- **Advanced Filtering**:
  - Search by email, entity type, or ID
  - Filter by action type (CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE, EXPORT)
  - Filter by data classification (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
  - Filter by success/failure status
  - Date range filtering
- **Detailed View**: Shows timestamp, user, action, entity, classification, status, and IP address
- **Pagination**: 50 entries per page with navigation
- **Export Capability**: Placeholder for secure export functionality

### 3. Compliance Reports (`/app/(dashboard)/security/reports/page.tsx`)

SOC 2 compliance reporting with:

- **Report Period Selection**: Last 7 days, This Month, or Last 90 days
- **Executive Summary**:
  - Overall health score with status badge
  - Total operations count
  - Security events with open count
  - Active users count
- **Visual Analytics**:
  - Daily activity trend (line chart)
  - Data access by classification (pie chart)
- **Compliance Check History**: Shows all compliance checks with status
- **Key Findings & Recommendations**: Automated analysis with actionable insights

### 4. Navigation Integration

- Added Security menu item to sidebar (`/components/sidebar.tsx`)
- Restricted access to admin and org_admin roles only
- Added Shield icon for visual identification

## GraphQL Queries Used

### Security Overview Query

```graphql
query SecurityOverview {
  metrics_24h: audit_log_aggregate(
    where: { created_at: { _gte: "now() - interval '24 hours'" } }
  )
  failed_operations: audit_log_aggregate(
    where: {
      success: { _eq: false }
      created_at: { _gte: "now() - interval '24 hours'" }
    }
  )
  critical_access: audit_log_aggregate(
    where: {
      data_classification: { _eq: "CRITICAL" }
      created_at: { _gte: "now() - interval '7 days'" }
    }
  )
  security_events: security_event_log(where: { resolved: { _eq: false } })
  compliance_checks: compliance_check(
    order_by: { performed_at: desc }
    limit: 1
  )
  data_access_7d: data_access_log_aggregate(
    where: { accessed_at: { _gte: "now() - interval '7 days'" } }
  )
}
```

### Audit Log Query

```graphql
query AuditLog(
  $limit: Int!
  $offset: Int!
  $where: audit_log_bool_exp
  $orderBy: [audit_log_order_by!]
) {
  audit_log(limit: $limit, offset: $offset, where: $where, order_by: $orderBy)
  audit_log_aggregate(where: $where)
}
```

### Compliance Report Query

```graphql
query ComplianceReport($startDate: timestamptz!, $endDate: timestamptz!) {
  audit_metrics: audit_log_aggregate(
    where: { created_at: { _gte: $startDate, _lte: $endDate } }
  )
  failed_by_type: audit_log(
    where: {
      success: { _eq: false }
      created_at: { _gte: $startDate, _lte: $endDate }
    }
  )
  data_access_stats: data_access_log_aggregate(
    where: { accessed_at: { _gte: $startDate, _lte: $endDate } }
  )
  security_events_stats: security_event_log_aggregate(
    where: { created_at: { _gte: $startDate, _lte: $endDate } }
  )
  user_activity: audit_log(
    where: { created_at: { _gte: $startDate, _lte: $endDate } }
    distinct_on: user_id
  )
  compliance_history: compliance_check(
    where: { performed_at: { _gte: $startDate, _lte: $endDate } }
  )
}
```

## Security Features

1. **Role-Based Access**: Only admin and org_admin roles can access the security dashboard
2. **Real-Time Monitoring**: Dashboard refreshes every 30 seconds
3. **Data Classification**: All data access is classified and color-coded
4. **Audit Trail**: Complete immutable audit log of all operations
5. **Compliance Tracking**: Automated compliance check results and history
6. **Visual Analytics**: Charts for trend analysis and pattern recognition

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

1. **Apply Database Migrations**: Run the audit table migrations if not already done
2. **Configure Hasura Permissions**: Ensure audit tables have proper permissions
3. **Test Dashboard**: Access `/security` in your application to test functionality

### Future Enhancements

1. **Export Implementation**:

   - Secure PDF/CSV export with encryption
   - Audit log for all exports
   - Data masking for sensitive fields

2. **Alerting System**:

   - Email alerts for critical security events
   - Slack/Teams integration
   - Custom alert thresholds

3. **Advanced Analytics**:

   - Machine learning for anomaly detection
   - Predictive compliance scoring
   - User behavior analytics

4. **Additional Pages**:
   - `/security/events` - Detailed security event management
   - `/security/access` - Data access log viewer
   - `/security/compliance` - Compliance check history
   - `/security/access-review` - User access review tool

## Usage Examples

### Accessing the Dashboard

```typescript
// Navigate to security dashboard
router.push("/security");

// Direct links to specific sections
router.push("/security/audit"); // Audit log
router.push("/security/reports"); // Compliance reports
```

### Monitoring Compliance

1. Check the Security Health Score on the main dashboard
2. Review any critical alerts at the top of the page
3. Navigate through tabs to see specific areas of concern
4. Generate compliance reports for auditors

### Investigating Issues

1. Use the audit log viewer with filters to find specific events
2. Check failed operations tab for system errors
3. Review critical data access for unauthorized attempts
4. Export filtered results for further analysis

## Compliance Benefits

1. **SOC 2 Type II**: Continuous monitoring demonstrates operational effectiveness
2. **Audit Trail**: Complete record of all data access and modifications
3. **Access Control**: Clear visibility into who accessed what data
4. **Incident Response**: Quick identification and investigation of security events
5. **Compliance Reporting**: Automated reports for auditors and management

The dashboard is now ready for use and provides comprehensive security monitoring and compliance reporting capabilities for your payroll system.
