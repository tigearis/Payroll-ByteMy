}

// AFTER: Pre-fetch Strategy (3 queries total)
const [allClients, allUsers, allCycles] = await Promise.all([
  fetchAllClientsMap(),        // 1 query - indexed lookup
  fetchAllUsersMap(),          // 1 query - indexed lookup  
  fetchAllCyclesMap()          // 1 query - indexed lookup
]);

// Process CSV with O(1) lookups
for (const row of csvRows) {
  const client = allClients.get(row.clientName);    // O(1) lookup
  const user = allUsers.get(row.userName);          // O(1) lookup

CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW billing_monthly_stats AS
SELECT 
  DATE_TRUNC('month', created_at) as month,
  status,
  client_id,
  COUNT(*) as item_count,
  SUM(amount) as total_amount,
  AVG(amount) as average_amount
FROM billing_items

**Our Approach**: Architectural solutions that scale
```typescript
// ❌ Ad-hoc fix (temporary improvement)
if (queryDuration > 1000) {
  addTimeout(query, 2000);
}

// ✅ Systematic optimization (permanent improvement)  
class PerformanceOptimizedQuery {
  constructor(query) {
    this.query = this.optimizeForPerformance(query);
    this.caching = new IntelligentCache(query);
    this.monitoring = new QueryPerformanceMonitor();
  }
}
```

### 2. **Business-Impact-Driven Decision Making**

**Impact Assessment Matrix**:
```
High Business Impact + High Technical Complexity = Strategic Priority
High Business Impact + Low Technical Complexity = Quick Win
