## Technical Implementation

### API Endpoints

#### GET `/api/reports/generate`

Returns available fields and relationships for report configuration.

**Response:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "availableFields": {
      "clients": ["id", "name", "contact_person", ...],
      "payrolls": ["id", "name", "status", ...],
      ...
    },
    "relationships": {
      "clients": {"payrolls": "payrolls"},
      "payrolls": {"client": "client", "payroll_dates": "payroll_dates"}
    },
    "domains": ["clients", "payrolls", "payroll_dates", "billing"]
  }
}
```

#### POST `/api/reports/generate`

Generates a report based on user configuration.

**Request:**

```json
{
  "domains": ["clients", "payrolls"],
  "fields": {
    "clients": ["name", "contact_person"],
    "payrolls": ["name", "status"]
  },
  "sortBy": "clients.name",
  "sortOrder": "asc",
  "limit": 100,
  "includeRelationships": true
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "clients_name": "Acme Corp",
      "clients_contact_person": "John Doe",
      "payrolls_name": "Acme Weekly Payroll",
      "payrolls_status": "Active"
    }
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "totalRecords": 25,
    "domains": ["clients", "payrolls"],
    "fields": {...}
  }
}
```

### Dynamic Query Generation

The system dynamically builds GraphQL queries based on user selections:

```graphql
query GenerateReport {
  clients(limit: 100, order_by: { name: ASC }) {
    name
    contact_person
    payrolls {
      name
      status
    }
  }
}
```

### Data Transformation

Results are transformed for CSV export with prefixed field names:

- `clients_name` instead of just `name`
- `payrolls_status` instead of just `status`
- Relationship counts added automatically

## Security & Permissions

### Access Control

- **Manager+ Required**: Only managers, admins, and developers can access
- **Audit Logging**: All report generation is logged
- **Data Filtering**: Respects existing row-level security

### Data Protection

- **Field Validation**: Only allowed fields can be selected
- **Query Limits**: Maximum 10,000 records per report
- **Relationship Validation**: Only valid relationships are processed

## Best Practices

### Performance

- Start with smaller field selections
- Use record limits for large datasets
- Consider relationship inclusion impact on performance

### Data Quality

- Verify field selections before generating
- Check preview data before downloading
- Use sorting to organize results logically

### Report Design

- Choose primary domain based on main focus
- Include related domains for context
- Use meaningful field combinations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No data returned"**

- Check if selected domains have data
- Verify field selections are valid
- Ensure relationships exist between domains

**"Query timeout"**

- Reduce record limit
- Select fewer fields
- Disable relationship inclusion

**"Download failed"**

- Check browser download settings
- Verify sufficient disk space
- Try smaller record sets

### Error Messages

- **"Insufficient permissions"**: Requires manager+ role
- **"Invalid field selection"**: Field not available in domain
- **"Relationship not found"**: Domains cannot be joined
- **"Query too complex"**: Reduce field/domain selections

## Future Enhancements
