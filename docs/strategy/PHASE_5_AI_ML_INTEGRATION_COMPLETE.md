    roles: ['executives'],
    decisionContext: 'strategic',
    timeContext: 'strategic'
  };

  const nlpGreeting = await naturalLanguageProcessingEngine.startConversation(businessContext);

  // Generate comprehensive predictive analytics
  const strategicPredictions = await aiMachineLearningAnalyticsEngine.generatePredictions('90d');
  
  // Analyze automation opportunities
  const automationInsights = await intelligentAutomationOrchestrator.analyzeOptimizationOpportunities(
    { domain: 'enterprise', analysisDepth: 'strategic' },
    'comprehensive'
  );

  // Create executive intelligence report
  const executiveIntelligence = await naturalLanguageProcessingEngine.generateIntelligentReport(
    { 
      predictions: strategicPredictions,
      automationInsights,
      strategicFocus: true 
    },
    'strategic',
    ['executives'],
    '90d'
  );

  return {
    conversationalGreeting: nlpGreeting,
    strategicPredictions,
    automationOpportunities: automationInsights,
    executiveReport: executiveIntelligence
  };
};
```

### **Operational AI Intelligence Pattern**

```typescript

  // Integrate operational data from multiple sources
  const operationalData = await dataIntegrationPipeline.queryData({
    sources: ['operations', 'performance', 'efficiency'],
    timeframe: '7d',
    includeRealTimeMetrics: true
  });

  // Generate operational predictions and insights
  const operationalPredictions = await aiMachineLearningAnalyticsEngine.generatePredictions('7d');
  const operationalInsights = await aiMachineLearningAnalyticsEngine.generateInsights(operationalData);

  // Identify automation opportunities
  const processOptimization = await intelligentAutomationOrchestrator.optimizeWorkflows(
    operationalData,
    { priority: 'efficiency', scope: 'operational' }
  );

  // Generate operational intelligence conversation
  const operationalNLP = await naturalLanguageProcessingEngine.continueConversation(
    "What are the top operational improvements we should implement this week?",
    { 
      operationalData,
      predictions: operationalPredictions,
      optimizations: processOptimization
    }
  );

  return {
    operationalData,
    predictions: operationalPredictions,
