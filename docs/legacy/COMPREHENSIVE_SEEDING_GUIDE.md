# Comprehensive Test Data Seeding Guide

## Quick Start

The comprehensive seeding system is now ready to use. Here are the most common commands:

```bash
# Basic seeding (development profile)
pnpm test:comprehensive:seed

# Preview what would be created (dry run)
pnpm test:comprehensive:dry-run

# Clean existing test data and reseed
pnpm test:comprehensive:clean

# Validate data integrity
pnpm test:comprehensive:validate

# Full cycle: clean, seed, and validate
pnpm test:comprehensive:full
```

## Common Workflows

### Development Setup
```bash
# Set up comprehensive test data for development
pnpm test:comprehensive:seed

# Validate everything is working
pnpm test:comprehensive:validate:verbose
```

### Testing Preparation
```bash
# Clean slate for testing
pnpm test:comprehensive:clean

# Create full test dataset
pnpm test:comprehensive:seed:testing

# Generate validation report
pnpm test:comprehensive:validate:report
```

### Performance Analysis
```bash
# Create large dataset
pnpm test:comprehensive:seed:performance

# Run performance validation
pnpm test:comprehensive:validate:report
```

### Quick Cleanup
```bash
# Remove only test data (preserves real users)
pnpm test:comprehensive:clean
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Environment Setup
```bash
# Ensure environment variables are set
echo $E2E_HASURA_GRAPHQL_URL
echo $HASURA_ADMIN_SECRET

# Check Hasura connectivity
pnpm test:comprehensive:dry-run
```

#### Permission Errors
- Verify Hasura admin secret is correct
- Check network connectivity to Hasura endpoint
- Ensure admin secret has proper permissions

#### Data Conflicts
```bash
# Clean existing test data first
pnpm test:comprehensive:clean

# Try minimal profile for debugging
pnpm test:comprehensive:seed:minimal
```

#### Validation Failures
```bash
# Get detailed validation information
pnpm test:comprehensive:validate:verbose

# Generate HTML report for analysis
pnpm test:comprehensive:validate:report
```

### Debug Mode
```bash
# See what would be created without executing
pnpm test:comprehensive:dry-run

# Use minimal dataset for faster debugging
pnpm test:comprehensive:seed:minimal --dry-run
```

## File Structure

```
scripts/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ seed-comprehensive-data.js     # Main seeding script
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ validate-comprehensive-data.js # Validation script
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [other existing scripts]

Generated Files:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test-data-seed-report.json     # Detailed seeding report
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data-validation-report.json    # Validation results
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ data-validation-report.html    # Visual validation report
```

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Pre-Development
```bash
# Ensure fresh test data
pnpm test:comprehensive:full
```

### During Development
```bash
# Quick validation after schema changes
pnpm test:comprehensive:validate
```

### Before Commits
```bash
# Validate data integrity
pnpm test:comprehensive:validate:verbose
```

### CI/CD Integration
```bash
# Minimal seeding for CI
pnpm test:comprehensive:seed:minimal

# Basic validation
pnpm test:comprehensive:validate
```

## Maintenance Schedule

### Daily
- Use `pnpm test:comprehensive:seed` for fresh development data

### Weekly
- Run `pnpm test:comprehensive:validate:report` for data quality review
- Clean and reseed with `pnpm test:comprehensive:full`

### Monthly
- Update seeding profiles based on new features
- Review and update realistic data patterns
- Performance test with `pnpm test:comprehensive:seed:performance`

### After Schema Changes
- Always run validation: `pnpm test:comprehensive:validate:verbose`
- Update seeding scripts if new tables/fields are added
- Test with dry run first: `pnpm test:comprehensive:dry-run`

## Extending the System

### Adding New Data Types
1. Update the appropriate generator class in `seed-comprehensive-data.js`
2. Add validation rules in `validate-comprehensive-data.js`
3. Test with dry run mode
4. Update this documentation

### Custom Profiles
Edit the `SEED_PROFILES` object in `scripts/seed-comprehensive-data.js`:

```javascript
const SEED_PROFILES = {
  custom: {
    users: 20,
    clients: 8,
    payrolls: 75,
    historical_months: 3,
    leave_records: 40,
    notes: 150
  }
};
```

### New Validation Rules
Add checks to the appropriate validation method in `validate-comprehensive-data.js`:

```javascript
async validateCustomRules() {
  // Add your custom validation logic
}
```

## Best Practices

### üéØ Do
- Always use dry run mode when testing new configurations
- Run validation after seeding operations
- Use appropriate profiles for different use cases
- Keep existing user data completely untouched
- Generate reports for important validations

### ‚ùå Don't
- Run seeding operations in production environments
- Modify the core user preservation logic
- Skip validation after seeding
- Use performance profiles for daily development
- Ignore validation warnings

### üîÑ Regular Maintenance
- Update realistic data patterns as business evolves
- Review and optimize seeding performance
- Keep validation rules current with business logic
- Monitor data quality trends over time

## Security Considerations

- All test data uses `.test.` domains and distinctive patterns
- No real email addresses or sensitive information
- Test data is clearly marked and easily identifiable
- Existing production data is completely preserved
- All operations are logged and auditable

## Performance Expectations

### Seeding Times (Approximate)
- **Minimal**: 30 seconds
- **Development**: 2-3 minutes
- **Testing**: 5-8 minutes
- **Performance**: 15-20 minutes

### Validation Times
- **Basic**: 10-15 seconds
- **Verbose**: 30-45 seconds
- **With Report**: 1-2 minutes

These times may vary based on network latency and Hasura performance.

## Support and Maintenance

This comprehensive seeding system is designed to be self-maintaining and reliable. For issues or enhancements:

1. Check the troubleshooting section above
2. Review the generated validation reports
3. Use dry-run mode to debug issues
4. Examine the detailed seeding reports

The system prioritizes data safety above all else - existing user data will never be modified or lost during any seeding operation.
