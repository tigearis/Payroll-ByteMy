### Security Configuration

The assistant respects these security boundaries:

- **Safe Tables**: Core business data (payrolls, clients, work_schedule)
- **Restricted Tables**: Limited access with field-level filtering (users)
- **Forbidden Tables**: No access (audit logs, auth tables, billing)

## User Interface

### Main Components

1. **Question Input**: Natural language question interface
2. **Answer Display**: Business-focused response with insights
3. **Data Visualization**: Rich presentation of query results
4. **Related Questions**: Suggested follow-up queries
5. **Export Options**: Download data in various formats

### User Experience

- **Conversational**: Ask questions in natural language
- **Contextual**: Suggestions based on current page
- **Visual**: Rich data presentation with charts and tables
- **Actionable**: Business insights and recommendations

## Role-based Access

### Access Levels

- **Developer**: Full access to all data and debug information
- **Org Admin**: Complete business data access
- **Manager**: Department-level data access
- **Consultant**: Project and client-specific data
- **Viewer**: Read-only access to basic information

### Permissions

The assistant automatically respects your existing Hasura permissions:

- Only shows data you're authorized to see
- Filters results based on your role
- Provides appropriate error messages for restricted data

## Development

### Adding New Business Domains

1. Update `SAFE_TABLES` in `hasura-query-generator.ts`
2. Add business context logic in `determineBusinessContext()`
3. Create domain-specific response templates
4. Add suggested questions for the new domain

### Customizing Responses

Modify these functions in `data-answer/route.ts`:

- `generateBusinessAnswer()`: Customize answer formatting
- `extractBusinessInsights()`: Add domain-specific insights
- `generateRelatedQuestions()`: Create contextual suggestions

### Schema Updates

The assistant automatically adapts to schema changes through:

- Real-time introspection
- Dynamic query generation
- Context-aware suggestions

## Monitoring & Analytics

### Logs

All interactions are logged with:
- User ID and role
- Question and answer content
- Execution time and performance metrics
- Security validation results
- Business context and data accessed

### Metrics

Track these key metrics:
- Questions per user/role
- Response accuracy and relevance
- Query performance and optimization
- User satisfaction and engagement

## Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Be Specific**: "Show me new clients this month" vs "Show me clients"
2. **Use Business Terms**: "revenue" instead of "billing_amount"
3. **Ask Follow-ups**: Use suggested related questions
4. **Context Matters**: Ask questions relevant to current page

### For Developers

1. **Security First**: Always validate permissions and data access
2. **Performance**: Monitor query complexity and execution time
3. **User Experience**: Focus on business value, not technical details
4. **Monitoring**: Log and analyze user interactions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"I don't have permission to access that data"**
- Check your role assignments
- Verify Hasura permissions
- Contact your administrator

**"No data found matching your criteria"**
- Try broader search terms
- Check date ranges
- Verify data exists in the system

**"Query execution failed"**
- Check Hasura connectivity
- Verify schema is up to date
- Review server logs for details

### Performance Issues

- Monitor query complexity
- Add database indexes for frequently queried fields
- Implement query result caching
- Set appropriate rate limits

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

1. **Advanced Visualizations**: Charts, graphs, and dashboards
2. **Query Caching**: Improve performance for common questions
3. **Export Formats**: PDF reports, Excel sheets, presentations
4. **Scheduled Reports**: Automated recurring insights
