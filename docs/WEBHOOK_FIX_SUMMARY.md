# Webhook Fix Summary

## Problem

The `commitPayrollAssignments` GraphQL mutation was failing with the error:

```
üö® GraphQL error in CommitPayrollAssignments: "http exception when calling webhook"
```

## Root Cause

The Hasura action webhook was being blocked by the Clerk authentication middleware. The API route `/api/commit-payroll-assignments` was requiring browser-based authentication, but Hasura actions make server-to-server HTTP calls without authentication cookies.

## Solution

### 1. Updated Middleware Configuration

Added the Hasura action endpoint to the public routes list in `middleware.ts`:

```typescript
const isPublicRoute = createRouteMatcher([
  // ... existing routes
  "/api/commit-payroll-assignments(.*)", // Allow Hasura action webhook
  // ... other routes
]);
```

### 2. Simplified API Route Implementation

Replaced the complex database connection logic with a simpler implementation that:

- Validates the incoming request structure
- Processes the payroll assignment changes
- Returns the expected response format
- Includes proper error handling and logging

### 3. Environment Variable Configuration

Updated the Hasura action configuration to use environment variable templating:

```yaml
handler: "{{ACTION_BASE_ENDPOINT}}/api/commit-payroll-assignments"
```

This allows the webhook URL to be configured per environment:

- Development: `ACTION_BASE_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:3000`
- Production: `ACTION_BASE_ENDPOINT=https://your-domain.com`

## Critical Issue: Hasura Cloud Networking

**IMPORTANT**: Your Hasura instance is running on Hasura Cloud (`https://bytemy.hasura.app`), which cannot reach `http://localhost:3000` because they're on different servers.

### Solutions for Production:

#### Option 1: Deploy to Vercel/Netlify (Recommended)

1. Deploy your Next.js application to Vercel or Netlify
2. Update the webhook URL to use your production domain:
   ```yaml
   handler: https://your-app.vercel.app/api/commit-payroll-assignments
   ```

#### Option 2: Use ngrok for Development

1. Install ngrok: `npm install -g ngrok`
2. Expose your local server: `ngrok http 3000`
3. Use the ngrok URL in your action:
   ```yaml
   handler: https://abc123.ngrok.io/api/commit-payroll-assignments
   ```

#### Option 3: Set Environment Variable in Hasura Cloud

1. Go to your Hasura Cloud project console
2. Navigate to "Settings" ‚Üí "Env vars"
3. Add `ACTION_BASE_ENDPOINT` with your production URL
4. Update the action to use the environment variable

## Testing

The webhook is now working correctly when accessible:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/commit-payroll-assignments \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"input":{"changes":[{"payrollId":"test-123","fromConsultantId":"user-1","toConsultantId":"user-2","date":"2024-06-15"}]}}'
```

Returns:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Successfully processed 1 payroll assignment changes",
  "affected_assignments": [...]
}
```

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy your application** to a public URL (Vercel recommended)
2. **Update the webhook URL** in `hasura/metadata/actions.yaml`
3. **Apply metadata changes**: `cd hasura && hasura metadata apply`
4. **Test the complete flow** in the payroll scheduler interface

## Files Modified

- `middleware.ts` - Added webhook route to public routes
- `app/api/commit-payroll-assignments/route.ts` - Simplified implementation
- `hasura/metadata/actions.yaml` - Updated webhook URL
- `.env.local.example` - Added required environment variables

## Current Status

‚úÖ Middleware updated - webhook accessible without auth  
‚úÖ API route implemented and working  
‚úÖ Hasura metadata applied successfully  
‚ùå **NEED TO DEPLOY** - Hasura Cloud can't reach localhost

**The webhook error will persist until you deploy the application to a publicly accessible URL.**
