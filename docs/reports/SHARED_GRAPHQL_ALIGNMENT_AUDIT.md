## Integration Opportunities

### 1. Type System Unification

**Current State:**
- Mixed manual and auto-generated types
- Duplication between shared/common.ts and generated types
- Inconsistent export patterns

**Optimization:**
```typescript
// Consolidate to single source of truth
export * from './generated/graphql';
export * from './generated/gql';

// Remove manual type definitions that duplicate GraphQL types
// Keep only truly shared business logic types
```

### 2. Fragment Composition Enhancement

**Current Fragments:**
```graphql
fragment UserMinimal on users {
  id
  name
  email
}

fragment UserBase on users {
  ...UserMinimal
  role
  isActive
  createdAt
}
```

**Enhancement Opportunities:**
- Add conditional fragments for permission-based field access
- Implement fragment interfaces for better reusability
- Add fragment directives for client-side optimizations

### 3. Query Optimization

**Current Implementation:**
- Dashboard queries aggregate data from multiple tables
- Search queries use ILIKE operations
- Real-time subscriptions with time-based filtering

**Optimization Opportunities:**
- Implement query batching for related operations
- Add query complexity analysis and limits
- Optimize subscription filters for better performance

### 4. Schema Federation Preparation

**Current Monolithic Schema:**
- Single Hasura endpoint with unified schema
- All domains share same schema namespace

**Federation Readiness:**
- Prepare for microservice architecture
- Implement schema stitching capabilities
- Add federation directives for future scaling

## Architecture Assessment

### Code Organization

**Strengths:**
- Clear separation between generated and manual code
- Domain-driven architecture with shared utilities

### Reusability Patterns

**Effective Patterns:**
- Hierarchical fragment composition
- Client Preset for type generation
- Security classification enforcement

**Less Effective:**
- Manual type definitions alongside generated types
- Complex multi-domain codegen setup
- Mixed import patterns

## Optimization Opportunities

### 1. Immediate Improvements (High Impact, Low Effort)

**Type System Cleanup:**
```typescript
// Remove duplicate types from shared/common.ts
// Use only GraphQL-generated types for API responses
export type { ApiResponse } from './generated/graphql';

// Consolidate validation types
export { commonSchemas } from './validation';
```

**Fragment Optimization:**
```graphql
# Add permission-aware fragments
fragment UserWithPermissions on users @include(if: $includePermissions) {
  ...UserBase
  assignedRoles {
    role {
      permissions {
        action
        resource
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Medium-Term Enhancements

**Query Performance:**
- Implement query batching for dashboard operations
- Add query complexity analysis
- Optimize subscription performance

**Schema Evolution:**
- Prepare for schema federation
- Implement schema versioning
- Add deprecation management

### 3. Long-Term Architecture

**Microservice Preparation:**
- Schema federation implementation
- Service-specific GraphQL endpoints
- Cross-service query orchestration

**Advanced Features:**
- GraphQL subscriptions with filtering
- Real-time query result caching
- Federated schema management

## Architecture Recommendations

### 1. Simplify Type System

**Current Issues:**
- Type duplication between manual and generated definitions
- Complex import patterns across domains
- Inconsistent type definitions

**Recommended Approach:**
```typescript
// shared/types/index.ts - Single source of truth
export * from './generated/graphql';
export * from './generated/gql';

// Keep only non-GraphQL business logic types
export * from './business-logic';
export * from './utilities';
```

### 2. Optimize Fragment Strategy

**Current Fragment Hierarchy:**
- 20+ fragments with good composition
- Some redundancy in field selections
- Missing permission-aware fragments

**Enhanced Strategy:**
```graphql
# Base fragments for core data
fragment EntityCore on entities {
  id
  createdAt
  updatedAt
}

# Permission-aware fragments
fragment UserSecure on users {
  ...UserCore
  email @include(if: $canViewPII)
  personalInfo @include(if: $canViewPII)
}
```

### 3. Streamline Codegen Configuration

**Current Configuration:**
- 461 lines of complex configuration
- Domain-by-domain generation strategy
- Multiple plugin configurations

**Simplified Approach:**
```typescript
// Unified configuration with cleaner domain handling
const config: CodegenConfig = {
  schema: HASURA_URL,
  generates: {
    // Single shared generation
    './shared/types/generated/': {
      preset: 'client',
      documents: ['./shared/graphql/**/*.graphql'],
    },
    // Domain-specific generations
    ...generateDomainConfigs()
  }
};
```
