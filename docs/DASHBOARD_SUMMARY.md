# Dashboard Real Data Integration - Summary

## What Was Changed

### Before

- Static numbers that never changed
- No real business insights
- Components used fake data arrays

### After

- Dashboard now fetches real data from Hasura GraphQL API
- Live statistics that reflect actual database state
- Business logic alerts for operational issues
- Proper loading states and error handling

## Key Files Modified

1. **`graphql/queries/dashboard/getDashboardStats.ts`** - New GraphQL queries for dashboard data
2. **`graphql/queries/dashboard/getAlerts.ts`** - New GraphQL queries for urgent alerts
