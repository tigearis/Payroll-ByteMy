- **Additional Relationships**: All missing relationships added for complete API coverage

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

#### Permission Hierarchy
```
viewer → consultant → manager → org_admin → developer
```

#### Key Permission Patterns

- **Consultant Assignment**: Access to assigned payrolls only  
- **User Ownership**: Personal data accessible only to owner
- **Approval Workflows**: Manager approval required for sensitive operations

### Enhanced Table Relationships

#### `services` table enhancements:
- `↔ clientServiceAssignments` - Service assignments to clients
- `↔ payrollServiceOverrides` - Payroll-specific rate overrides
- `↔ payrollServiceQuantities` - Service quantities per payroll
- `↔ timeEntries` - Time tracking with service assignment

#### `clients` table enhancements:
- `↔ clientServiceAssignments` - Assigned services
- `↔ invoices` - Generated invoices

#### `users` table enhancements:
- `↔ userBillingRates` - Personal billing rates
- `↔ createdBillingRecords` - Created billing records

#### `time_entries` table enhancements:
- `→ assignedService` - Service for billable time
- New billing fields: `user_hourly_rate`, `calculated_fee`, `is_billable_to_service`
