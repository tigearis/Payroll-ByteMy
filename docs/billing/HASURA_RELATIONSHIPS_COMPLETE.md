## Relationship Validation

### ✅ Metadata Consistency Check
```bash
hasura metadata ic list --envfile .env
# Result: "metadata is consistent" ✅
```

### ✅ Successful Metadata Application
```bash
hasura metadata apply --envfile .env
# Result: Applied without errors ✅
```

## GraphQL Schema Impact

These relationships enable powerful GraphQL queries such as:

### User-Centric Queries
```graphql
query UserBillingActivity($userId: uuid!) {
  users_by_pk(id: $userId) {
    id
    computed_name
    
    # Personal billing rates
    userBillingRatesForUser {
      hourly_rate
      seniority_level
      effective_from
      effective_to
    }
    
    # Created invoices
    createdInvoices {
      invoice_number
      total_amount
      status
      created_at
    }
    
    # Service assignments created
    clientServiceAssignmentsCreated {
      client {
        name
      }
      service {
        name
      }
      custom_rate
    }
    
    # Payroll overrides approved
    payrollServiceOverridesApproved {
      override_rate
      override_reason
      payroll {
        client {
          name
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Invoice Line Item Details
```graphql
query InvoiceLineItemDetails($invoiceId: uuid!) {
  invoice_line_items(where: {invoice_id: {_eq: $invoiceId}}) {
    id
    description
    quantity
    unit_price
    line_total
    
    # Original billing item
    billingItem {
      service_code
      original_amount
    }
    
    # User who made adjustments
    adjustedByUser {
      computed_name
    }
  }
}
```

### Payroll Service Analytics
```graphql
query PayrollServiceAnalytics($payrollId: uuid!) {
  payrolls_by_pk(id: $payrollId) {
    id
    client {
      name
    }
    
    # Service overrides
    payrollServiceOverrides {
      service {
        name
      }
      override_rate
      override_reason
      createdByUser {
        computed_name
      }
      approvedByUser {
        computed_name
      }
    }
    
    # Payroll dates with quantities
    payrollDates {
      eft_date
      payrollServiceQuantities {
        service {
          name
        }
        quantity
        enteredByUser {
          computed_name
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
