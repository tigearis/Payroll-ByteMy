## üõ°Ô∏è Key Security Implementations

### Security & Compliance Dashboard

_Source: `SECURITY_DASHBOARD_IMPLEMENTATION.md`_

A comprehensive security and compliance dashboard has been implemented to provide real-time monitoring of security events, audit trails, and compliance status.

- **Location**: `/app/(dashboard)/security/`
- **Key Features**:
  - **Real-time Metrics**: Displays a security health score, total operations, failed operations, and critical data access events.
  - **Audit Log Viewer**: An advanced viewer for the `audit_log` with powerful filtering and search capabilities.
  - **Compliance Reports**: Automated SOC 2 compliance reports with visual analytics and historical data.
- **Access Control**: Access is strictly limited to users with the `admin` or `org_admin` role.

### Database User Verification Guard

_Source: `SECURITY-FIX-DATABASE-USER-VERIFICATION.md`_

A critical security guard, `DatabaseUserGuard`, was implemented to resolve a vulnerability where users authenticated with Clerk but not present in the application's database were granted default access.

- **Location**: `components/auth/DatabaseUserGuard.tsx`
- **Functionality**:
  1.  Wraps the entire application within the provider chain.
  2.  Verifies that the authenticated user exists in the `users` table in the database.
  3.  If the user does not exist, access is blocked, and the user is prompted to sync their account.
  4.  This prevents unverified users from gaining any level of access to the application, even with default "viewer" permissions.

### Secure Authentication & Admin Secret Migration

_Source: `SECURITY_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`_

A major security migration was performed to eliminate the exposure of the Hasura admin secret in client-accessible code and to harden API security.

- **Admin Secret Removal**: The `HASURA_ADMIN_SECRET` is no longer used directly. A secure service (`lib/secure-hasura-service.ts`) with a limited-permission service account token is used for admin operations.
- **API Authentication**: A `withAuth` wrapper has been implemented for API routes to enforce role-based access control, rate limiting, and webhook signature validation.
- **Security Headers**: Comprehensive security headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.) and a strict CORS policy have been implemented to prevent common web vulnerabilities.

## üîß TECHNICAL DEBT & REFACTOR INVENTORY

### üî¥ CRITICAL TECHNICAL DEBT

#### Type Safety Issues

- **Issue**: Multiple files using `any` types bypassing TypeScript safety
- **Locations**: Found in 10+ core files including Apollo client configurations
- **Impact**: Runtime errors, maintainability issues, decreased development velocity
- **Recommendation**: Implement strict TypeScript configuration and eliminate all `any` types

#### Code Duplication

- **Issue**: Authentication logic duplicated across multiple API routes
- **Locations**: `/app/api/` directory, multiple auth implementations
- **Impact**: Maintenance overhead, consistency issues, security gaps
- **Recommendation**: Consolidate into shared authentication utilities and middleware

#### Dead Code Accumulation

- **Issue**: Multiple backup files and unused dependencies
- **Locations**: `.backup`, `.old` files throughout codebase, package.json
- **Impact**: Bundle size increase, confusion, maintenance overhead
- **Recommendation**: Automated dead code detection and elimination

### üü† HIGH TECHNICAL DEBT

#### Naming Convention Inconsistencies

- **Locations**: No tests found for critical business logic components
- **Impact**: Quality assurance gaps, deployment confidence issues
- **Recommendation**: Implement comprehensive testing strategy with automated coverage

### üü° MEDIUM TECHNICAL DEBT

#### GraphQL Code Generation Inconsistencies

- **Issue**: Inconsistent GraphQL type generation across domains
- **Locations**: `/domains/*/graphql/generated/` directories
- **Impact**: Type mismatches, development friction
- **Recommendation**: Standardize GraphQL code generation processes

#### Configuration Management

- **Issue**: Environment configuration scattered across multiple files
- **Locations**: Various config files without central management
- **Impact**: Configuration drift, environment-specific bugs
- **Recommendation**: Centralize configuration management with validation

## üè™ BUSINESS LOGIC RISKS

### üî¥ CRITICAL BUSINESS RISKS

#### Financial Logic Client-Side Exposure

- **Issue**: Payroll and tax calculations accessible in browser
- **Locations**: Tax calculator component, payroll service frontend code
- **Impact**: Financial manipulation, regulatory compliance violations
- **Recommendation**: Move all financial calculations to audited server-side APIs

#### Data Integrity Validation Gaps

- **Issue**: Missing validation for critical business operations
- **Locations**: Payroll processing, employee data management
- **Impact**: Data corruption, business process failures
- **Recommendation**: Implement comprehensive business rule validation

### üü† HIGH BUSINESS RISKS

#### Role Management Client-Side Dependencies

- **Issue**: Role-based UI decisions made without server validation
- **Locations**: Multiple components checking roles for display logic
- **Impact**: Potential authorization bypass
- **Recommendation**: Server-side validation for all role-dependent operations

#### Business Rule Fragmentation

- **Issue**: Business logic scattered across frontend and backend
- **Locations**: Validation logic in components and API routes
- **Impact**: Inconsistent business rule enforcement
- **Recommendation**: Centralize business rules in domain services

## üîß Troubleshooting Permissions

If you encounter errors like `field '...' not found in type: 'users'`, it indicates a permission issue. Follow these steps to debug:

1.  **Check Current User Role in Browser**: Use browser developer tools to inspect the Clerk session data or JWT token and identify the user's current role.
2.  **Verify JWT Token Claims**: Decode the JWT token using a tool like [jwt.io](https://jwt.io) to ensure it contains the correct Hasura claims (`x-hasura-role`, `x-hasura-user-id`, etc.).
3.  **Confirm Role in Clerk Dashboard**: Check the user's `public_metadata.role` in the Clerk Dashboard. For full access, it should be `"developer"`.
4.  **Apply Hasura Metadata**: Ensure the latest Hasura metadata is applied by running `hasura metadata apply`.
5.  **Force Token Refresh**: Sign out, clear browser cache, and sign back in to ensure you have the latest token.

### Most Likely Cause

The most common issue is that the user does not have the correct role assigned in Clerk's `public_metadata`. Updating the role to `"developer"` and re-authenticating typically resolves the issue.

## üîê Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) System

A sophisticated, enterprise-grade RBAC system has been implemented, following industry best practices.

### Key Features:

- **Hierarchical Role System**: A priority-based inheritance model with 5 core roles (Developer, Org Admin, Manager, Consultant, Viewer). Higher priority roles automatically inherit all permissions from lower ones.
- **Granular Permissions**: The system supports 15 resource types (e.g., payrolls, clients, staff) with multiple actions each (read, create, update, delete, manage).
- **Permission Overrides**: A flexible override system allows for user-specific or role-level overrides with automatic expiration and a full audit trail.
- **Clerk & Hasura Integration**: A seamless integration with Clerk for authentication and Hasura for real-time, role-based data access control, using a custom JWT claims function.
