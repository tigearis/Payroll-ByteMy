## Payroll-ByteMy System

Generated: ${new Date().toISOString()}

---

## Executive Summary

This report documents the comprehensive logging and audit infrastructure implemented in the Payroll-ByteMy system to meet SOC2 Type II compliance requirements. The system now includes database-level audit trails, application-level logging, security event monitoring, and compliance reporting capabilities.

---

## 1. Database Audit Infrastructure

### 1.1 Audit Schema Implementation

A dedicated `audit` schema has been created with the following tables:

#### **audit.audit_log**
- **Purpose**: General audit trail for all data modifications
- **Retention**: 7 years (SOC2 requirement)
- **Key Fields**:
  - `event_time`: Timestamp of the event
  - `user_id`, `user_email`, `user_role`: User identification
  - `action`: Type of operation (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
  - `resource_type`, `resource_id`: Affected entity
  - `old_values`, `new_values`: Change tracking (encrypted for sensitive data)
  - `ip_address`, `user_agent`: Client information
  - `session_id`, `request_id`: Request tracking

#### **audit.auth_events**
- **Purpose**: Authentication and authorization events
- **Key Events Tracked**:
  - Login success/failure
  - Logout events
  - Password changes
  - MFA enablement/disablement
  - Session timeouts

#### **audit.data_access_log**
- **Purpose**: Track data access for compliance
- **Key Fields**:
  - `resource_type`, `resource_id`: What was accessed
  - `access_type`: view, export, download, print
  - `data_classification`: CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW
  - `fields_accessed`: Specific fields viewed
  - `row_count`: Amount of data accessed

#### **audit.permission_changes**
- **Purpose**: Track all permission and role modifications
- **Key Fields**:
  - `changed_by_user_id`: Who made the change
  - `target_user_id`, `target_role_id`: What was changed
  - `change_type`: grant, revoke, modify
  - `old_permissions`, `new_permissions`: Change tracking

### 1.2 Automatic Audit Triggers

Database triggers automatically log changes to sensitive tables:

```sql
-- Triggers implemented on:
- public.users (user management)
- public.payrolls (payroll data)
- public.clients (client information)
- public.user_roles (permission changes)
- public.role_permissions (role modifications)
```

### 1.3 Row-Level Security (RLS)

RLS policies have been implemented on sensitive tables to ensure data access is properly controlled:

- **users**: Users can only see themselves or based on role hierarchy
- **payrolls**: Access restricted to assigned consultants, managers, and admins
- **payroll_dates**: Inherits access from parent payroll
- **clients**: Access based on assigned payrolls
- **notes**: Access based on entity ownership

---

## 2. Application-Level Logging

### 2.1 Existing Audit Logger (`/lib/audit/audit-logger.ts`)

The system already includes a comprehensive audit logger with:

- **Data Classification**: CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW
- **Audit Actions**: CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE, EXPORT, BULK_OPERATION
- **Encryption**: Sensitive data encrypted before storage
- **Decorator Support**: `@Audited` decorator for automatic method logging

### 2.2 New SOC2 Logger (`/lib/logging/soc2-logger.ts`)

Enhanced logging service specifically for SOC2 compliance:

#### **Features**:
1. **Comprehensive Event Types**:
   - Access Control (CC6.1)
   - User Management (CC6.2)
   - Data Access (CC6.3)
   - System Changes (CC7.1)
   - Security Events (CC7.2)
   - Compliance (CC7.3)

2. **Log Levels**:
   - DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL, SECURITY, AUDIT

3. **Log Categories**:
   - AUTHENTICATION, AUTHORIZATION, DATA_ACCESS, DATA_MODIFICATION
   - SYSTEM_ACCESS, CONFIGURATION_CHANGE, SECURITY_EVENT
   - PERFORMANCE, ERROR, COMPLIANCE

4. **Advanced Features**:
   - Request tracing (trace_id, span_id)
   - Performance metrics tracking
   - Error detail capture with stack traces
   - Buffered logging with retry mechanism
   - Critical event alerting

---

## 3. Security Event Monitoring

### 3.1 Automatic Suspicious Activity Detection

Database function `check_suspicious_activity()` monitors for:

- **Multiple Failed Login Attempts**: 5+ failures in 5 minutes triggers warning
- **Excessive Data Exports**: 10+ exports in 1 hour triggers error alert
- **Unusual Access Patterns**: Detected through query analysis

### 3.2 Security Event Classifications

```typescript
export enum SOC2EventType {
  // Security Events
  UNAUTHORIZED_ACCESS,
  SUSPICIOUS_ACTIVITY,
  RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED,
  INVALID_INPUT,
  SECURITY_SCAN,
}
```

---

## 4. Compliance Reporting Views

### 4.1 User Access Summary (`audit.user_access_summary`)

Provides compliance-ready reports showing:
- Total actions per user
- Read vs write operation counts
- Login success/failure rates
- Last activity timestamps

### 4.2 Permission Usage Report (`audit.permission_usage_report`)

Tracks:
- Which permissions are assigned
- Which permissions are actually used
- Last usage timestamps
- User counts per permission

---

## 5. Data Retention and Archival

### 5.1 Retention Policies

- **Audit Logs**: 7 years (SOC2 requirement)
- **Data Access Logs**: 5 years
- **Security Events**: 3 years after resolution
- **Unresolved Security Events**: Archived after 1 year

### 5.2 Automatic Cleanup

Function `audit.archive_old_logs()` handles:
- Deletion of logs beyond retention period
- Archival of unresolved security events
- Performance optimization through old data removal

---

## 6. Performance Optimizations

### 6.1 Database Indexes Added

```sql
-- New performance indexes
idx_payroll_assignments_assigned_by
idx_billing_invoice_client_id
idx_notes_created_at
idx_payrolls_active_dates
idx_users_active_staff
idx_payroll_dates_future
idx_payrolls_current_version
```

### 6.2 Materialized Views

- **payroll_dashboard_stats**: Pre-aggregated dashboard data
- Refreshed hourly for optimal performance

### 6.3 Query Performance Monitoring

- **audit.slow_queries** table tracks queries exceeding thresholds
- Automatic alerting for performance degradation

---

## 7. Encryption and Data Protection

### 7.1 Field-Level Encryption

Functions implemented for sensitive data:
- `encrypt_sensitive()`: Encrypts CRITICAL/HIGH classified data
- `decrypt_sensitive()`: Decrypts for authorized access
- Placeholder for integration with key management system

### 7.2 Audit Log Protection

- Triggers prevent modification of audit logs
- Deletion only allowed after retention period
- Immutable audit trail guaranteed

---

## 8. Integration Points

### 8.1 Hasura Integration

- Audit schema exposed to Hasura
- Permissions granted for audit log insertion
- Read-only access for compliance reporting

### 8.2 Application Integration

```typescript
// Example usage in API routes
import { soc2Logger, SOC2EventType, LogCategory } from '@/lib/logging/soc2-logger';

// Log data access
await soc2Logger.log({
  level: LogLevel.INFO,
  category: LogCategory.DATA_ACCESS,
  eventType: SOC2EventType.DATA_VIEWED,
  message: "User viewed payroll data",
  entityType: "payroll",
  entityId: payrollId,
  metadata: { fields: ["salary", "tax_info"] }
}, request);
```

### 8.3 Decorator Usage

```typescript
@SOC2Logged(SOC2EventType.DATA_UPDATED, LogCategory.DATA_MODIFICATION)
async updatePayroll(id: string, data: any) {
  // Method automatically logged
}
```
